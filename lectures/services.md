A service is a special type of class that provides a way to interact with some functionality in the application in a simpler way. A service can provide all sorts of different functionality, for example:

- Send emails
- Uploading files
- Interacting with database tables (JPA repositories)
- Interacting with an external API

Services allow us to decouple the specific logic for performing actions, like the above, from the rest of our application and call those methods from anywhere.
